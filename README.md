## How it Works

The process can be explained in the following steps :-

- The function `validateForm` takes two arguments (`formElements` and `errorFunction`)
- `formElements` is a mandatory argument which takes an array of all the input elements which have to be validated
- `errorFunction` is an optional argument which takes a function to show Error if the some fields are incomplete
- It then checks `formElements` is an array or not. If not, then it throws an error
- It runs a `for loop` and checks all the elements if the field is complete or not
- If any of the field is incomplete then an error will store the name of which field is incomplete and then the error is shown by an `alert`
- If `errorFunction` is defined, then that function will be called
